# Recipe Example

This is the first full example in the NERDS stack, this examples fully uses SAM instead of ExpressJS for the backend. We will be working with a recipe sharing website! Where users can create recipes, collections, comment, share and subscribe to users, and at the end they could add elemnts to their shopping lists to buy the goods required to cook the recipe.

**TODO**: This project is still work in progress and it needs additional documentation, we will be releasing the features by phases (which will be tracked in the release table below), the first one is an initial portion of the backend with only users and recipes interactions, and we will build all the way up to the full application, this approach is to make it easier to consume rather than a big bang!

To execute this project please:

1. Open the [backend](./backend/README.md) folder with instructions to execute the backend locally.
2. Open the [frontend](./frontend/README.md) folder with instructions to execute the front end and run your web applicaation locally.
