# üóÇÔ∏è Schema Design - # Update me !!

Designing an efficient and scalable data model is crucial when working with Amazon DynamoDB. This folder contains a collection of schema design patterns and best practices that you can leverage in your DynamoDB table implementations.

## üîç Explore the Patterns

Delve into the various schema design approaches and discover how they can help you optimize your DynamoDB data models:

    Global Secondary Indexes (GSI): Learn how to leverage GSIs to enable efficient queries and data access patterns.
    Composite Primary Keys: Understand how to structure your primary keys to support complex query requirements.
    Time Series Data: Explore strategies for modeling time-series data in DynamoDB, such as using Time to Live (TTL) and Time Series Tables.
    One-to-Many Relationships: Discover techniques for modeling one-to-many relationships in your DynamoDB tables.
    Many-to-Many Relationships: Investigate approaches for handling many-to-many relationships using DynamoDB's flexible data model.
    Hierarchical Data: Learn how to represent hierarchical data structures, such as organizational charts or nested categories, in your DynamoDB tables.

Each design pattern is accompanied by sample code, performance considerations, and real-world use cases to help you make informed decisions for your DynamoDB applications.
