# 🤝 Contributing to the DynamoDB SDK Examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Amazon DynamoDB SDK example documentation! 🙌 We greatly value the feedback and contributions from our amazing community.

Before you dive in, please take a moment to read through these guidelines. They'll help us work together more effectively and ensure your contributions have the greatest impact.

## 🌟 What to Expect When You Contribute

When you submit a pull request, our team will be notified and we'll do our best to respond as quickly as possible.

We'll work with you to ensure your pull request adheres to our style and standards. If we merge your pull request, we might make additional edits later for style or clarity.

Please note that the AWS documentation source files on GitHub aren't published directly to the official documentation website. If we merge your pull request, we'll publish your changes as soon as we can, but they won't appear immediately or automatically.

We welcome your pull requests for:

- 📚 New content you'd like to contribute (such as code examples or tutorials)
- 🐛 Inaccuracies in the existing content
- 🧭 Information gaps that need more detail to be complete
- 📝 Typos or grammatical errors
- 🔍 Suggested rewrites that improve clarity and reduce confusion

**Note:** We know everyone has their own writing style, and you might not always agree with ours. We want that feedback! Just make sure your request for a rewrite is supported by the criteria above. If it's not, we might have to politely decline.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

To contribute, send us a pull request. For small changes, like fixing a typo or adding a link, you can use the [GitHub Edit Button](https://blog.github.com/2011-04-26-forking-with-the-edit-button/). For larger changes:

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. In your fork, make your change in a branch that's based on this repo's **master** branch.
3. Commit the change to your fork, using a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/), answering any questions in the pull request form.

Before you send us a pull request, please make sure:

1. You're working from the latest source on the **master** branch.
2. You've checked [existing open](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/pulls) and [recently closed](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) pull requests to avoid duplicating efforts.
3. If your contribution will take significant time, [create an issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-dynamodb-examples/issues/new) first to discuss your idea with us.

## 💡 Guidelines for Contributing Code Examples

We want to raise the bar for code examples, so they provide maximum value to users. When submitting a new code example, please include the following:

- 📖 A README.md file at the root level, describing the example, prerequisites, and how to run it.
- 🧱 Modular, reusable code that accepts inputs and returns outputs.
- 🧪 Unit tests to help users run the example.
- 🌐 Standard error or exception handling for easier troubleshooting.

If your code example is missing any of these elements, we may ask you to include them before merging.
