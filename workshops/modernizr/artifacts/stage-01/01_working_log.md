# Stage 01 Working Log

## Task 1: Identify current application access patterns

### Progress
- [x] Read backend README.md to understand API structure
- [x] Examined all route files in backend/src/routes/
- [x] Analyzed auth.ts routes
- [x] Analyzed products.ts routes  
- [x] Analyzed categories.ts routes
- [x] Analyzed orders.ts routes
- [x] Analyzed cart.ts routes
- [x] Analyzed seller.ts routes
- [x] Examined User model structure
- [ ] Document complete API access patterns
- [ ] Analyze entity relationships
- [ ] Enumerate access patterns for DynamoDB design

### Key Findings
- Application has 6 main route modules: auth, products, categories, orders, cart, seller
- Mix of public and authenticated endpoints
- Role-based access (regular users vs sellers)
- Pagination support on list endpoints
- Search functionality across products and categories
- Shopping cart functionality with inventory validation
- Order management with status updates

## Task 2: Analyze MySQL database logs for performance data

### Progress
- [x] Located mysql_log_parser.py script in database/ folder
- [x] Extracted mysql-query.log from mysql-query.zip
- [x] Ran MySQL log parser analysis
- [x] Analyzed performance data and query patterns
- [ ] Document MySQL log analysis results
- [ ] Commit analysis with proper message

### Key Findings from Log Analysis
- **Total Queries**: 6,974 executions across 80 unique queries over 1.5 hours
- **Throughput**: 1.29 queries/second overall, 1.44 queries/second active
- **Query Distribution**: 100% SELECT queries (6,972) + 2 TRUNCATE operations
- **Top Patterns**: Product browsing (883 executions), category listing (876), product search (373-371 per search term)
- **Search Terms**: Heavy usage of "laptop", "shoes", "phone", "book", "shirt" searches
- **Product Detail Views**: Specific product IDs accessed frequently (7965: 236 times, 7964: 194 times)
- **Performance**: Most queries show consistent sub-second execution patterns

## Task 3: Extract complete table structure using MySQL MCP server

### Progress
- [x] Connected to MySQL MCP server
- [x] Identified online_shopping_store database
- [x] Extracted complete table structures (6 tables)
- [x] Analyzed foreign key relationships (8 relationships)
- [x] Documented indexes and constraints (20+ indexes)
- [x] Gathered data volume statistics
- [ ] Document complete table structure analysis
- [ ] Commit analysis with proper message

### Key Findings from Schema Analysis
- **6 Core Tables**: users, categories, products, orders, order_items, shopping_carts
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Self-referencing parent_id structure (25 categories)
- **Rich Indexing**: Full-text search on products, performance indexes on key fields
- **Foreign Key Integrity**: Complete referential integrity with 8 FK relationships
- **Data Volumes**: 4 users, 25 categories, 6 products, 0 orders/cart items
- **Unique Constraints**: Username/email uniqueness, unique user-product cart combinations

### Next Steps
- Complete comprehensive table structure documentation
- Map all entity relationships and cardinalities
- Document complete data model for DynamoDB migration
