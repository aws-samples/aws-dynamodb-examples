## Critical Execution Guidelines

**⚠️ CRITICAL TEST EXECUTION GATES**:
- **NEVER** modify existing test cases or test files
- **ALWAYS** create NEW test files for DynamoDB-specific functionality
- **DUAL TEST STRATEGY**: Create both unit tests (with mocked DynamoDB client) and integration tests (with real DynamoDB Local)
- **UNIT TESTS**: Use mocks for fast business logic validation and edge case testing
- **INTEGRATION TESTS**: Use real DynamoDB Local for end-to-end validation - NEVER use mocks for integration tests
- **ALWAYS** run existing tests before making any code changes
- **ALWAYS** run all tests (existing + unit + integration) after each substantive change
- **NEVER** proceed with implementation if tests cannot be run
- **NEVER** proceed if tests are failing unless failures are explicitly documented and understood

**Implementation Methodology**:
- Use exact same programming language version as existing repository
- Write code that matches existing repository conventions
- Follow test-driven development: failing test → minimum code → tests pass → refactor
- **Create NEW test files** for DynamoDB repositories (e.g., `UserRepository.dynamodb.test.js`)
- **DO NOT modify existing test files** - only create new ones
- Implement one entity at a time, testing after each
- Read files before attempting to change them

**DynamoDB-Specific Requirements**:
- Use real DynamoDB Local via Docker, never mocks
- Follow migrationContract.json specifications exactly
- Preserve MySQL IDs in same format, cast to DynamoDB types
- Handle 400KB item size limits and throughput constraints
- Implement proper error handling with exponential backoff

- Ensure that caching strategies are properly implemented

**Configuration Issues**:
- Verify that production configuration uses SDK defaults
- Check that credentials are properly configured for different environments
- Ensure that DynamoDB Local is only used in test environments
- Validate that environment-specific configurations are working correctly
