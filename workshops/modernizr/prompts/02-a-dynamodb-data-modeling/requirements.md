# DynamoDB Data Modeling with MCP Server - Requirements

## Introduction

The DynamoDB Data Modeling with MCP Server stage leverages specialized MCP tools to transform MySQL schema analysis into an optimized DynamoDB data model. This stage simplifies the modeling process by using expert MCP servers while maintaining comprehensive validation and producing the critical migration contract for subsequent stages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DynamoDB architect, I want to systematically gather access pattern requirements and leverage MCP server expertise, so that I can efficiently create an optimal data model based on real usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gathering requirements THEN the system SHALL analyze stage-01 artifacts to extract entities, relationships, and initial access patterns
2. WHEN documenting patterns THEN the system SHALL require RPS estimates for EVERY pattern and never fabricate numbers
3. WHEN preparing for MCP analysis THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive input documentation with all necessary context
4. WHEN requirements are incomplete THEN the system SHALL not proceed until user confirms all patterns are captured
5. WHEN requirements are complete THEN the system SHALL have documented all read and write patterns ready for MCP server analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database designer, I want to leverage MCP server expertise for DynamoDB design, so that I can apply proven design principles and patterns efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide complete context including entities, relationships, access patterns, and RPS estimates
2. WHEN requesting design THEN the system SHALL specify multi-table first approach with natural keys and access pattern driven design
3. WHEN evaluating alternatives THEN the system SHALL request multiple design options with trade-off analysis
4. WHEN receiving recommendations THEN the system SHALL validate that all access patterns are satisfied
5. WHEN finalizing design THEN the system SHALL ensure comprehensive justifications and cost analysis are provided

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious architect, I want MCP server analysis of denormalization decisions and cost implications, so that I can make informed decisions about performance vs complexity vs cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating denormalization THEN the system SHALL request MCP server analysis of denormalization trade-offs with production risk assessment
2. WHEN analyzing costs THEN the system SHALL obtain total cost of ownership analysis including development velocity and operational overhead
3. WHEN assessing risks THEN the system SHALL request hot partition vulnerability analysis and write amplification calculations
4. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL ensure explicit trade-offs with rollback strategies are documented
5. WHEN comparing approaches THEN the system SHALL obtain multiple design alternatives with clear justifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a migration engineer, I want a detailed migration contract in exact JSON format generated with MCP server assistance, so that subsequent stages can automatically generate infrastructure and migration code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating migration contract THEN the system SHALL use MCP server to generate the EXACT JSON structure specified with all required fields
2. WHEN mapping attributes THEN the system SHALL ensure proper type mappings (S, N, B) and source table/column references
3. WHEN handling denormalization THEN the system SHALL include denormalized=true, justification, and join object specifications
4. WHEN managing unique constraints THEN the system SHALL implement dedicated lookup tables with TransactWriteItems patterns
5. WHEN completing contract THEN the system SHALL validate that all access patterns are satisfied by the designed tables and GSIs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation of MCP server outputs with table-by-table review, so that I can ensure the data model meets all requirements and the user understands each design decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving MCP outputs THEN the system SHALL validate that all original access patterns are addressed
2. WHEN reviewing design THEN the system SHALL conduct table-by-table validation with the user for each DynamoDB table
3. WHEN validating each table THEN the system SHALL explain the purpose, source mapping, key design, and access patterns served
4. WHEN checking user understanding THEN the system SHALL not proceed to the next table until the user confirms understanding of the current table
5. WHEN finalizing design THEN the system SHALL obtain user approval of the complete design after individual table validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a database architect, I want detailed explanation of table consolidation and denormalization decisions, so that I can understand why multiple MySQL tables are combined into single DynamoDB tables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating tables THEN the system SHALL clearly explain which MySQL tables are being combined and why
2. WHEN denormalizing data THEN the system SHALL provide detailed justification for each denormalization decision
3. WHEN presenting table design THEN the system SHALL show the mapping between source MySQL tables and target DynamoDB table
4. WHEN validating design THEN the system SHALL ensure user understands the trade-offs of table consolidation
5. WHEN documenting decisions THEN the system SHALL record user feedback and any concerns about table design
