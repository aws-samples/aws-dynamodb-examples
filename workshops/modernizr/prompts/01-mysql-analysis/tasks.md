# MySQL Analysis - Tasks

- [x] 0. Set up Git source control for the project
  - Initialize GIT at the root of this workspace so you have a point to revert your changes if needed in the future
  - You must always use git -P to avoid getting stuck in git operations
  - The subfolders have compiled projects, make sure to create a gitignore so you track only what you will be modifying not the compiled version or the node_modules
  - Use a temporary file called `artifacts/stage-00/00_0_working_log.md` so you can track what is your current work and important notes and use it as a reference
  - Update the file task.md once completed, please let the user know that you have completed this task and summarize what has been done
  - Commit the latest changes registered in the working log and other artifacts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 1. Identify current application access patterns
  - Make sure you have a clean commit log
  - From the backend/ folder use the README.md to understand its API endpoints
  - Explore the backend/ folder to understand in detail the available access patterns
  - Generate a file where you store the results of your investigation in `artifacts/stage-01/` under the name `01_1_API_access_patterns.md`
  - Use a temporary file called `artifacts/stage-01/01_1_working_log.md` so you can track what is your current work and important notes and use it as a reference
  - The result of the API access patterns must include a detailed explanation on the relationship between the different entities
  - Update the file task.md once completed, please let the user know that you have completed this task and summarize what has been done
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Read MySQL source database information
  - Make sure you have a clean commit log
  - From the database/ folder use the mysql_log_parser.py script to capture mysql query statistics
  - Use the MySQL MCP server's execute_sql tool to run SQL queries and collect the actual schema information deployed in the database, that will be used to understand the entity relationships
  - Write and execute SQL queries to extract table structures, relationships, indexes, and constraints for the online shopping store database
  - Using both results generate a comprehensive report where you explain the entity relationship information, table structure and add the access patterns at the bottom to understand the nature of the workload. DO NOT SUGGEST A DYNAMODB TABLE STRUCTURE
  - Generate focused artifacts as you progress: schema extraction results, entity relationships, table structures, performance analysis, and access patterns in separate files under `artifacts/stage-01/`
  - Use a temporary file called `artifacts/stage-01/01_2_working_log.md` so you can track what is your current work and important notes and use it as a reference
  - Update the file task.md once completed, please let the user know that you have completed this task and summarize what has been done
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.3, 4.5_

## Output Validation Checklist

Before marking this stage complete, verify:
- [x] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [x] Working log files created in artifacts/stage-00/ and artifacts/stage-01/ directories
- [ ] Modular artifacts created for each analysis component:
  - [x] `artifacts/stage-01/01_1_API_access_patterns.md` - Backend API endpoints and access patterns
  - [ ] `artifacts/stage-01/01_2_schema_extraction.md` - Raw SQL query results
  - [ ] `artifacts/stage-01/01_3_entity_relationships.md` - E-commerce entity analysis
  - [ ] `artifacts/stage-01/01_4_table_structures.md` - Detailed table definitions
  - [ ] `artifacts/stage-01/01_5_performance_analysis.md` - mysql_log_parser.py results
  - [ ] `artifacts/stage-01/01_6_access_patterns.md` - Identified access patterns
- [ ] All MySQL tables, relationships, and constraints are documented in focused artifacts
- [ ] Access patterns are identified from mysql_log_parser.py analysis
- [ ] Entity relationship information explains e-commerce domain structure
- [ ] Table structure includes detailed column definitions and constraints
- [ ] Performance analysis results from Python script are included
- [ ] Documentation focuses on current state analysis without DynamoDB suggestions
- [ ] All changes are committed to Git with meaningful messages

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Git Setup Issues:**
- Ensure Git is installed and configured
- Use git -P flag to avoid interactive prompts
- Check .gitignore covers node_modules, dist/, build/, coverage/ directories
- Verify artifacts/ directory is tracked but build outputs are ignored

**MySQL Log Parser Issues:**
- Verify mysql_log_parser.py exists in database/ folder
- Check if MySQL log files are available for analysis
- Ensure Python 3.6+ is available for running the script
- Handle cases where log files might be empty or missing

**MCP Server Connection Issues:**
- Verify MCP server configuration in mcp.json
- Check MySQL database connectivity and credentials
- Ensure required MCP tools are available and trusted
- Test connection with simple queries before full extraction

**Schema Extraction Problems:**
- Verify database user has sufficient permissions for schema access
- Check for tables with special characters or reserved names
- Ensure all databases/schemas are accessible
- Handle large schemas with appropriate timeouts
