# Dual-Database Abstraction - Tasks

## IMPORTANT SCOPE CLARIFICATION

**This stage focuses EXCLUSIVELY on the backend/ folder. Do not modify or analyze the frontend/ folder.**

The online shopping store has two main components:
- **backend/**: Node.js/TypeScript API server with MySQL database (THIS IS OUR FOCUS)
- **frontend/**: React application (IGNORE FOR THIS STAGE)

All tasks, analysis, and modifications should be limited to the backend/ folder and its contents.

## DISCOVERY-DRIVEN APPROACH

This stage follows a discovery-driven approach where Q first explores the backend codebase to understand its structure, then generates appropriate requirements and design specifications based on the actual code found.

## COMMIT FREQUENCY

**IMPORTANT**: Commit changes frequently throughout this stage to maintain a clean Git history. Each major task completion should include a commit with a descriptive message. Use `git -P` to avoid interactive prompts.

- [ ] 1. Explore and document backend codebase structure
  - [ ] 1.1 Comprehensive backend codebase exploration
    - **SCOPE**: Focus exclusively on the backend/ folder - do not analyze frontend/ folder
    - Read and analyze backend/README.md to understand the application structure and setup
    - Examine backend/package.json to identify dependencies, scripts, and technologies used
    - Explore backend/src/ directory structure to understand the application architecture
    - Identify and document all data access related files (repositories, services, models, database config)
    - Document the programming language (TypeScript/JavaScript), database technology (MySQL), and frameworks used
    - Create a comprehensive analysis document: `artifacts/stage-03/03_1_backend_analysis.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit the analysis artifacts with message "Add backend codebase analysis for DAL abstraction"
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

  - [ ] 1.2 Analyze backend data access patterns and test structure
    - **SCOPE**: Focus only on backend test coverage in backend/src/__tests__/
    - Examine existing repository and service classes to understand current data access patterns
    - Analyze the test structure and identify test frameworks and patterns used
    - Document existing interfaces, classes, and methods that handle data access
    - Identify any existing abstraction layers or patterns that can be leveraged
    - Document current database connection and configuration patterns
    - Create detailed documentation: `artifacts/stage-03/03_2_data_access_analysis.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit the data access analysis with message "Add backend data access pattern analysis"
    - _Requirements: 1.3_

  - [ ] 1.3 Generate dual-database abstraction requirements and design based on discovery
    - Based on the backend analysis, generate specific requirements for the dual-database abstraction
    - Create a tailored design document that matches the actual backend architecture found
    - Define specific interfaces needed based on the actual repositories and services discovered
    - Create implementation plan that respects the existing backend patterns and conventions
    - Design the dual-database abstraction layer with feature flag support
    - Plan for DynamoDB stub implementations (actual implementation will happen in stage 04)
    - Generate artifacts: `artifacts/stage-03/03_3_dal_requirements.md` and `artifacts/stage-03/03_4_dal_design.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit the generated requirements and design with message "Add tailored dual-database requirements and design with feature flag support"
    - **CRITICAL**: Only after this step should the actual implementation begin
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 2. Validate backend environment and implement DAL abstraction
  - [ ] 2.1 Validate backend environment and create baseline
    - **CRITICAL**: Verify all backend tests are passing before proceeding with any changes
    - Run complete backend test suite (npm test from backend/ folder) and document any existing failures
    - Recommend creating a branch or backup of the codebase
    - Establish baseline metrics for backend test coverage and performance
    - **SCOPE**: Only run and validate backend tests - frontend tests are not relevant for this stage
    - _Requirements: 2.5_

  - [ ] 2.2 Implement abstract interfaces based on generated design
    - Follow the specific design document created in step 1.3
    - Create abstract interfaces matching the actual backend DAL classes discovered
    - Implement interfaces according to the patterns and conventions found in the backend
    - **CRITICAL**: Run tests after every change to ensure no breaking changes and correct syntax
    - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.1_

  - [ ] 2.3 Continue with remaining implementation steps
    - Follow the detailed implementation plan created in the generated design document
    - Implement concrete classes, factory pattern, application integration, test updates, and configuration
    - Use the discovery-based requirements and design as the detailed specification
    - Document progress in `artifacts/stage-03/03_5_implementation_log.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit implementation progress regularly with descriptive messages (e.g., "Implement dual-database interfaces", "Add feature flag configuration", "Update tests for dual-database support")
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 3. Final validation and documentation
  - [ ] 3.1 Comprehensive validation of implemented abstraction layer
    - **CRITICAL**: Verify all existing backend tests pass with the new implementation
    - Confirm error handling is consistent across implementations
    - Validate that configuration management works correctly
    - Document final results in `artifacts/stage-03/03_6_validation_results.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit final validation results with message "Complete DAL abstraction implementation with validation results"
    - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.4, 3.5_

  - [ ] 3.2 Prepare for DynamoDB implementation stage
    - **IMPORTANT**: Only after completing all steps and passing tests, ask user's permission to proceed
    - Confirm that the abstraction layer is ready for DynamoDB implementation
    - Validate that all interfaces are properly designed for NoSQL patterns
    - Document any considerations for the upcoming DynamoDB implementation
    - Create handoff documentation for the next stage
    - _Requirements: 3.5_

## Critical Execution Guidelines

**Test Execution Gates**:
- Run tests before starting any changes
- Run tests after every complete code change
- Never proceed if tests are failing unless failures are documented and understood
- Maintain or improve test coverage throughout the process

**Code Modification Rules**:
- Don't introduce new languages or frameworks into the codebase
- Match existing conventions and patterns exactly
- Read files before attempting to change them
- Preserve existing implementation behavior exactly
- Make a copy of the script in codebase and track progress

**Progressive Implementation**:
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next
- Mark steps as DONE only when constraints are satisfied
- Continue working until ALL steps are marked DONE
- Don't delete or edit constraints or examples in the original script

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Test Failures**:
- Review error messages carefully and identify root cause
- Check that interfaces match existing implementations exactly
- Verify that factory pattern is correctly instantiating implementations
- Ensure configuration is properly loaded and validated

**Integration Issues**:
- Verify that dependency injection patterns are preserved
- Check that application code changes are minimal and non-breaking
- Ensure that error handling is consistent across implementations
- Validate that transaction boundaries are properly maintained

**Configuration Problems**:
- Verify configuration file format and structure
- Check that all required configuration parameters are present
- Ensure environment-specific configurations are properly loaded
- Test configuration validation and error reporting
