# Dual-Database Abstraction - Tasks

## IMPORTANT SCOPE CLARIFICATION

**This stage focuses EXCLUSIVELY on the backend/ folder. Do not modify or analyze the frontend/ folder.**

The online shopping store has two main components:
- **backend/**: Node.js/TypeScript API server with MySQL database (THIS IS OUR FOCUS)
- **frontend/**: React application (IGNORE FOR THIS STAGE)

All tasks, analysis, and modifications should be limited to the backend/ folder and its contents.

## DISCOVERY-DRIVEN APPROACH

This stage follows a discovery-driven approach where Q first explores the backend codebase to understand its structure, then generates appropriate requirements and design specifications based on the actual code found.

## COMMIT FREQUENCY AND TASK COMPLETION

**IMPORTANT**: 
- **Commit changes frequently** throughout this stage to maintain a clean Git history
- **Use `git -P`** to avoid interactive prompts
- **Mark tasks as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` as you finish each task
- **Commit after each major task completion** with descriptive messages
- **Update the tasks.md file** itself when marking tasks complete and commit those changes too
- **Use single working log**: Use `artifacts/stage-03/03_working_log.md` throughout the entire stage (not individual logs per subtask)
- **DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE**: Only add a [x] mark to complete the task, for tracking purposes.

- [ ] 1. Explore and document backend codebase structure
  - [ ] 1.1 Comprehensive backend codebase exploration
    - **SCOPE**: Focus exclusively on the backend/ folder - do not analyze frontend/ folder
    - **FIRST**: Create working log file `artifacts/stage-03/03_working_log.md` to track progress and important notes throughout this entire stage
    - Read and analyze backend/README.md to understand the application structure and setup
    - Examine backend/package.json to identify dependencies, scripts, and technologies used
    - Explore backend/src/ directory structure to understand the application architecture
    - Identify and document all data access related files (repositories, services, models, database config)
    - Document the programming language (TypeScript/JavaScript), database technology (MySQL), and frameworks used
    - Create a comprehensive analysis document: `artifacts/stage-03/03_1_backend_analysis.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit the analysis artifacts with message "Add backend codebase analysis for DAL abstraction"
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

  - [ ] 1.2 Analyze backend data access patterns and test structure
    - **SCOPE**: Focus only on backend test coverage in backend/src/__tests__/
    - Examine existing repository and service classes to understand current data access patterns
    - Analyze the test structure and identify test frameworks and patterns used
    - Document existing interfaces, classes, and methods that handle data access
    - Identify any existing abstraction layers or patterns that can be leveraged
    - Document current database connection and configuration patterns
    - Create detailed documentation: `artifacts/stage-03/03_2_data_access_analysis.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit the data access analysis with message "Add backend data access pattern analysis"
    - _Requirements: 1.3_

  - [ ] 1.3 Generate dual-database abstraction requirements and design based on discovery
    - Based on the backend analysis, generate specific requirements for the dual-database abstraction
    - Create a tailored design document that matches the actual backend architecture found
    - Define specific interfaces needed based on the actual repositories and services discovered
    - Create implementation plan that respects the existing backend patterns and conventions
    - Design the dual-database abstraction layer with feature flag support
    - Plan for DynamoDB stub implementations (actual implementation will happen in stage 04)
    - Generate artifacts: `artifacts/stage-03/03_3_dal_requirements.md` and `artifacts/stage-03/03_4_dal_design.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit the generated requirements and design with message "Add tailored dual-database requirements and design with feature flag support"
    - **CRITICAL**: Only after this step should the actual implementation begin
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 2. Validate backend environment and implement DAL abstraction
  - [ ] 2.1 Validate backend environment and create baseline
    - **CRITICAL**: Verify all backend tests are passing before proceeding with any changes
    - Run complete backend test suite (npm test from backend/ folder) and document any existing failures
    - Recommend creating a branch or backup of the codebase
    - Establish baseline metrics for backend test coverage and performance
    - **SCOPE**: Only run and validate backend tests - frontend tests are not relevant for this stage
    - _Requirements: 2.5_

  - [ ] 2.2 Implement abstract interfaces based on generated design
    - Follow the specific design document created in step 1.3
    - Create abstract interfaces matching the actual backend DAL classes discovered
    - Implement interfaces according to the patterns and conventions found in the backend
    - **CRITICAL**: Run tests after every change to ensure no breaking changes and correct syntax
    - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.1_

  - [ ] 2.3 Continue with remaining implementation steps
    - Follow the detailed implementation plan created in the generated design document
    - Implement concrete classes, factory pattern, application integration, and configuration
    - Use the discovery-based requirements and design as the detailed specification
    - **CRITICAL**: For EVERY file you create or modify, document it in `artifacts/stage-03/03_working_log.md` with:
      - File path and name
      - Purpose of the file (interface, concrete implementation, stub, configuration, etc.)
      - Whether it's a MySQL implementation, DynamoDB stub, or shared component
      - Brief description of what the file contains
    - **IMPORTANT**: Clearly mark which files are DynamoDB stubs that will need real implementation in stage-04
    - Document progress in `artifacts/stage-03/03_5_implementation_log.md`
    - **COMMIT**: Commit implementation progress regularly with descriptive messages (e.g., "Implement dual-database interfaces", "Add feature flag configuration")
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

  - [ ] 2.4 Create comprehensive unit tests for new abstraction layer components
    - **CRITICAL**: Follow stage-04 testing principles - NEVER modify existing test files, ALWAYS create NEW test files
    - **SCOPE**: Create unit tests only for newly created abstraction layer components, not existing backend code
    - Create NEW test files for all abstraction layer components:
      - Abstract interfaces: `AbstractRepository.test.js` (or similar based on actual interface names)
      - Factory pattern implementation: `DatabaseFactory.test.js` 
      - Configuration management system: `DatabaseConfig.test.js`
      - Feature flag integration: `FeatureFlag.test.js`

    - **TESTING APPROACH**: Use unit testing with mocks for dependencies, focusing on business logic validation
    - **CRITICAL**: Run existing backend tests before creating new tests to ensure baseline functionality
    - **CRITICAL**: Run all tests (existing + new) after creating each new test file
    - Ensure new tests cover edge cases, error conditions, and configuration scenarios
    - Document test coverage and any testing considerations in implementation log
    - **COMMIT**: Commit new test files with message "Add comprehensive unit tests for dual-database abstraction layer components"
    - **MARK COMPLETE**: Update this task to [x] and commit the tasks.md change

## Critical Execution Guidelines

**Test Execution Gates**:
- Run tests before starting any changes
- Run tests after every complete code change
- Never proceed if tests are failing unless failures are documented and understood
- Maintain or improve test coverage throughout the process

**Code Modification Rules**:
- Don't introduce new languages or frameworks into the codebase
- Match existing conventions and patterns exactly
- Read files before attempting to change them
- Preserve existing implementation behavior exactly
- Make a copy of the script in codebase and track progress

**Progressive Implementation**:
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next
- Mark steps as DONE only when constraints are satisfied
- Continue working until ALL steps are marked DONE
- Don't delete or edit constraints or examples in the original script

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Test Failures**:
- Review error messages carefully and identify root cause
- Check that interfaces match existing implementations exactly
- Verify that factory pattern is correctly instantiating implementations
- Ensure configuration is properly loaded and validated

**Integration Issues**:
- Verify that dependency injection patterns are preserved
- Check that application code changes are minimal and non-breaking
- Ensure that error handling is consistent across implementations
- Validate that transaction boundaries are properly maintained

**Configuration Problems**:
- Verify configuration file format and structure
- Check that all required configuration parameters are present
- Ensure environment-specific configurations are properly loaded
- Test configuration validation and error reporting
