  - Confirm implementation follows data model specifications exactly
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Execute Feature Flags System Stage
  - Navigate to `.kiro/specs/05-feature-flags-system/` spec
  - Provide completed DAL implementations as input
  - Execute the complete 05-feature-flags-system spec
  - Validate output: Web interface for controlling 5 migration phases
  - Test all migration scenarios: MySQL-only → dual-write → dual-read → DynamoDB-only
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 6. Execute Infrastructure Deployment Stage
  - Navigate to `.kiro/specs/06-infrastructure-deployment/` spec
  - Provide `migrationContract.json` as input
  - Execute the complete 06-infrastructure-deployment spec
  - Validate output: DynamoDB tables deployed with proper configuration
  - Confirm all tables, GSIs, and monitoring are properly configured
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Execute Data Migration Stage
  - Navigate to `.kiro/specs/07-data-migration-execution/` spec
  - Provide deployed infrastructure and migration contract as inputs
  - Execute the complete 07-data-migration-execution spec
  - Validate output: Data successfully migrated with validation reports
  - Confirm data integrity and completeness through validation checks
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 8. Generate Migration Summary and Documentation
  - Compile comprehensive migration report including:
    - Summary of all stages completed
    - Performance metrics and validation results
    - Rollback procedures and recovery guidance
    - Lessons learned and operational recommendations
  - Create final documentation package for ongoing maintenance
  - Provide cleanup scripts for temporary resources
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

## Stage Validation Checklist

Before proceeding to the next stage, verify:
- [ ] All required input artifacts are available and properly formatted
- [ ] Current stage spec has been executed completely (all tasks marked complete)
- [ ] All output artifacts are generated in correct format and location
- [ ] Tests pass (where applicable)
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] No blocking issues or errors remain unresolved

## Troubleshooting Guide

**If a stage fails:**
1. Review the specific stage's requirements and design documents
2. Check that all input dependencies are properly formatted
3. Verify the execution environment meets the stage's prerequisites
4. Consult the stage-specific troubleshooting guidance
5. If needed, restart from the failed stage after resolving issues

**Common Issues:**
- Missing or incorrectly formatted input artifacts
- Environment setup issues (MCP server, DynamoDB Local, etc.)
- Test failures due to environment configuration
- AWS permissions or region configuration problems
