# Data Migration Execution - Requirements

## Introduction

The Data Migration Execution stage orchestrates the complete migration of data from MySQL to DynamoDB using specialized MCP servers for database operations, AWS Glue ETL jobs, and comprehensive monitoring. This stage emphasizes proper MCP server integration, data integrity, and comprehensive validation throughout the migration process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to generate and execute MySQL views using MCP server integration, so that I can transform relational data according to the migration contract specifications with proper database connectivity and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating views THEN the system SHALL use the migration contract as the definitive source for view definitions and transformations
2. WHEN connecting to MySQL THEN the system SHALL use MySQL MCP server for all database operations including connection discovery and query execution
3. WHEN creating views THEN the system SHALL handle all join patterns defined in the migration contract (self-join, foreign-key, multi-column, conditional, chain, lookup-table, json-construction)
4. WHEN executing SQL THEN the system SHALL use MCP server calls for secure and monitored database operations
5. WHEN validating views THEN the system SHALL verify that all views are created successfully and return expected data transformations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cloud engineer, I want to create and execute AWS Glue ETL jobs using Glue MCP server integration, so that I can migrate data from MySQL views to DynamoDB tables with proper monitoring and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Glue jobs THEN the system SHALL use Glue MCP server for all AWS Glue operations including job creation, script management, and execution
2. WHEN configuring jobs THEN the system SHALL use migration contract specifications to determine source views, target tables, and transformation logic
3. WHEN managing scripts THEN the system SHALL use S3 MCP server operations for script upload and management
4. WHEN executing jobs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring and progress tracking through MCP server calls
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive retry mechanisms and error reporting through MCP server integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to manage DynamoDB operations using DynamoDB MCP server integration, so that I can ensure proper table creation, data validation, and performance monitoring throughout the migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating tables THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB MCP server for all table creation and configuration operations
2. WHEN validating schema THEN the system SHALL verify that created tables match migration contract specifications including keys, GSIs, and attributes
3. WHEN monitoring migration THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB MCP server to track write operations, capacity utilization, and error rates
4. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive data integrity checks using MCP server operations
5. WHEN handling capacity THEN the system SHALL monitor and adjust table capacity settings through DynamoDB MCP server calls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and validation of the migration process using MCP server integration, so that I can ensure data integrity, track progress, and handle errors effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates for all migration phases using MCP server telemetry
2. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive data integrity checks comparing source and target data through MCP server operations
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent retry mechanisms and error recovery using MCP server capabilities
4. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL generate detailed migration reports including success rates, error logs, and performance metrics
5. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive validation reports and operational guidance for ongoing management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want proper MCP server orchestration and coordination, so that I can ensure all migration components work together seamlessly with proper error handling and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orchestrating migration THEN the system SHALL coordinate between MySQL MCP, Glue MCP, DynamoDB MCP, and S3 MCP servers
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure proper sequencing of operations across different MCP servers
3. WHEN handling failures THEN the system SHALL implement cross-MCP server error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL validate that all required MCP servers are operational before starting migration
5. WHEN completing operations THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup and resource management across all MCP servers
