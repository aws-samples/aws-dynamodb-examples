**Implementation Methodology**:
- **Wrapper Approach**: Add wrappers on top of existing database logic, don't modify existing logic
- **CSS Preservation**: DO NOT modify existing CSS configurations to avoid breaking functionality
- **MySQL Priority**: Always write to MySQL first in dual-write scenarios to preserve ID generation
- **Attribute-Based Validation**: Compare dual-read results by attribute names, not string comparison

**Migration Phase Requirements**:
1. **Phase 1**: Write to MySQL, Read from MySQL
2. **Phase 2**: Dual Writes, Read from MySQL
3. **Phase 3**: Dual Writes, Read from both (with validation)
4. **Phase 4**: Dual Writes, Read from DynamoDB
5. **Phase 5**: Write to DynamoDB, Read from DynamoDB
