# Feature Flags System - Tasks

## COMMIT FREQUENCY AND TASK COMPLETION

**IMPORTANT**: 
- **Commit changes frequently** throughout this stage to maintain a clean Git history
- **Use `git -P`** to avoid interactive prompts
- **Mark tasks as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` as you finish each task
- **Commit after each major task completion** with descriptive messages
- **Update the tasks.md file** itself when marking tasks complete and commit those changes too
- **Use single working log**: Use `artifacts/stage-05/05_working_log.md` throughout the entire stage (not individual logs per subtask)
- **DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE**: Only add a [x] mark to complete the task, for tracking purposes.

- **CSS Preservation**: DO NOT modify existing CSS configurations to avoid breaking functionality
- **MySQL Priority**: Always write to MySQL first in dual-write scenarios to preserve ID generation
- **Attribute-Based Validation**: Compare dual-read results by attribute names, not string comparison

**Migration Phase Requirements**:
1. **Phase 1**: Write to MySQL, Read from MySQL
2. **Phase 2**: Dual Writes, Read from MySQL
3. **Phase 3**: Dual Writes, Read from both (with validation)
4. **Phase 4**: Dual Writes, Read from DynamoDB
5. **Phase 5**: Write to DynamoDB, Read from DynamoDB
