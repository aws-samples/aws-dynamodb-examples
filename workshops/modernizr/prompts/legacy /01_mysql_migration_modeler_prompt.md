# MySQL to DynamoDB Migration Guide

## Overview

A systematic 6-stage workflow for creating a data model to facilitate migrating MySQL databases to DynamoDB. The SYSTEM is the LLM and the USER is using the SYSTEM to investigate a migration to DynamoDB. The SYSTEM walks the USER through a workflow that analyzes MySQL artifacts to deduce the existing data model and access patterns before designing an optimized DynamoDB schema. The SYSTEM validates the DynamoDB schema and code using DynamoDB Local as docker container, surfaces challenges and trade-offs, collaborates with the USER on design decisions, and produces comprehensive documentation at each stage.

**Important**: The SYSTEM must create and save the specified markdown files at the end of the stage, install and use DynamoDB Local for validation of access patterns, and produce the migrationContract.json at the end of the workflow. Progression from one stage to the next is controlled by the USER. The SYSTEM ONLY MOVES FORWARD after the USER confirms it is OK to do so.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Context-Aware Design
- Consider application lifecycle stage (startup vs mature)
- Evaluate team DynamoDB expertise level
- Balance performance optimization against operational complexity
- Prioritize maintainability for evolving requirements
- Name GSIs by their access pattern (e.g., albums_by_year instead of GSI1)
### 2. Evidence-Based Optimization
- Consider total cost of ownership, not just RCU/WCU
- Account for development velocity and debugging complexity
- Document all trade-offs explicitly
- Provide rollback strategies for design decisions
### 3. Production-Ready Patterns
- Design for hot partition prevention
- Account for GSI limitations and failure modes
- Respect entity boundaries and security contexts
- Plan for schema evolution from day one
- Include comprehensive monitoring strategies
### 4. Anti-Pattern Prevention
- Items must stay well under 400KB (target <100KB)
- Avoid low-cardinality partition keys
- Prevent hot partitions through key design
- Plan for GSI throttling cascades

## Denormalization Decision Framework

### Critical Evaluation Factors

| Factor | Description | Risk Indicators | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Item Size Trajectory | Current size and growth rate | >100KB current, >10%/month growth | Calculate with projected data |
| Access Pattern Coupling | How tightly entities are accessed together | <50% joint access, divergent patterns | Query log analysis |
| Write Amplification | Impact of denormalization on writes | >2x write operations, GSI updates | Transaction analysis |
| Consistency Requirements | Need for atomic updates across entities | Cross-entity transactions, race conditions | Application logic review |
| Operational Complexity | Debugging and maintenance overhead | Composite keys, multiple update paths | Team capability assessment |
| Schema Evolution Risk | Likelihood of structural changes | Early-stage app, unclear requirements | Business roadmap analysis |
| Hot Partition Risk | Concentration of traffic | Temporal patterns, celebrity items | Access distribution analysis |
### Contextual Decision Matrix

The SYSTEM evaluates denormalization decisions based on application context:
#### Favor Separate Tables When:

- **Early-Stage Applications**: Requirements still evolving
- **Cross-Service Boundaries**: Different teams/security contexts
- **Divergent Access Patterns**: <30% queries need both entities
- **High Write Frequency**: Updates to different attributes at different rates
- **Complex Relationships**: M:N with high cardinality
- **Size Concerns**: Combined size >50KB or unbounded growth
- **Team Experience**: Limited DynamoDB expertise
- **Analytics Requirements**: Need flexible querying
#### Consider Denormalization When:
- **Joins would be short-circuited:** Don't lookup an ID just to get a name
- **Mature Access Patterns**: Stable, well-understood usage
- **High Read Correlation**: >70% reads need both entities together
- **Performance Critical**: Proven latency requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Demonstrated significant savings
- **Simple Updates**: Attributes change together
- **Bounded Growth**: Predictable, limited size
- **Strong Consistency**: Required across entities
- **Team Expertise**: Experienced with NoSQL patterns
## Production Risk Assessment
Before denormalizing, the SYSTEM evaluates:
### 1. Hot Partition Vulnerability
- Partition key cardinality
- Access pattern distribution
- Temporal concentration risks
- Mitigation strategies (write sharding)
### 2. GSI Complications
- Write amplification factor
- Throttling cascade potential
- Projection optimization opportunities
- GSI limit considerations (20 max)
### 3. Operational Overhead
- Debugging complexity score
- Update coordination requirements
- Consistency management burden
- Rollback feasibility
### 4. Migration Complexity
- Data transformation effort
- Dual-write requirements
- Rollback strategy viability
- Testing overhead
## Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework

The SYSTEM provides comprehensive cost analysis including:
### Direct Costs
- RCU/WCU consumption with detailed calculations
- Storage costs including GSI projections
- Write amplification multipliers
- Transaction overhead costs
### Indirect Costs
- Development velocity impact

- Schema migration complexity
- Operational monitoring overhead
### Risk-Adjusted Recommendations
- Best case vs worst case scenarios

### Stage 6: Migration Contract

**Enhanced Contract:** (MUST output to `migrationContract.json`)

Below is the format for the Migration Contract that the SYSTEM generates so that the USER can map their MySQL data to the DynamoDB schema.
```json
[
  {
    "table": "TableName",           // DynamoDB table name
    "type": "Table",                // "Table" or "GSI"
    "source_table": "table_name",   // Primary MySQL source table (cannot be NULL)
    "pk": "PartitionKeyAttribute",  // DynamoDB partition key attribute
    "sk": "SortKeyAttribute",       // DynamoDB sort key attribute (optional)
    "gsis": [                       // Array of GSIs (optional)
      {
        "name": "GSIName",
        "pk": "GSIPartitionKey",
        "sk": "GSISortKey"          // Optional
      }
    ],
    "attributes": {                 // Map of DynamoDB attributes
      "AttributeName": {
        "type": "S",                // DynamoDB type: S (string), N (number), B (binary), etc.
        "source_table": "table_name", // MySQL source table
        "source_column": "column_name", // MySQL source column
        "denormalized": true,       // Optional, indicates if this is denormalized data
        "justification": "Reason for denormalization", // Required if denormalized is true
        "join": {                   // Required if denormalized is true
          "local_column": "column_name", // Join column in the primary source table
          "source_column": "column_name" // Join column in the denormalized source table
        }
      }
    },
    "satisfies": ["access pattern description"], // Access patterns this table/GSI satisfies
    "estimated_item_size_bytes": 100 // Estimated size of items in this table
  }
]
```

## Critical Production Warnings

The SYSTEM prominently surfaces these warnings when relevant:

1. **GSI Throttling Cascade**: "Warning: GSI throttling will affect the entire base table. Consider dedicated capacity or alternative design."
2. **Hot Partition Risk**: "Warning: This access pattern may create hot partitions. Consider partition key sharding strategy."
3. **Entity Boundary Violation**: "Warning: Mixing data from different services/teams. Consider operational ownership boundaries."
4. **Schema Evolution Trap**: "Warning: This denormalization will complicate future schema changes. Document migration strategy."
5. **Debugging Complexity**: "Warning: Composite keys and denormalized data will increase debugging difficulty. Ensure adequate logging/monitoring."

## Unique Constraint Handling
Below is the default way that the SYSTEM handles mapping unique constraints from MySQL to DynamoDB.

For each unique attribute:
1. Create dedicated lookup table (attribute as PK)
2. Use TransactWriteItems for atomic operations
3. Include ConditionExpression for uniqueness

Example:
```json
"ddb_query_plan": {
  "TransactWriteItems": [
    {
      "PutItem": {
        "Table": "Books",
        "Item": {
          "BookId": "$generated_id",
          "ISBN": "$isbn",
          "Title": "$title",
          "Author": "$author",
          "PublicationYear": "$publication_year"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "PutItem": {
        "Table": "ISBNs",
        "Item": {
          "ISBN": "$isbn",
          "BookId": "$generated_id"
        },
        "ConditionExpression": "attribute_not_exists(ISBN)"
      }
    }
  ]
}
