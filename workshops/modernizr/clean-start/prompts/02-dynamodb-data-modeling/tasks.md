# DynamoDB Data Modeling - Tasks

## COMMIT FREQUENCY AND TASK COMPLETION

**IMPORTANT**: 
- **Commit changes frequently** throughout this stage to maintain a clean Git history
- **Use `git -P`** to avoid interactive prompts
- **Mark tasks as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` as you finish each task
- **Commit after each major task completion** with descriptive messages
- **Update the tasks.md file** itself when marking tasks complete and commit those changes too
- **Use single working log**: Use `artifacts/stage-02/02_working_log.md` throughout the entire stage (not individual logs per subtask)
- **DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE**: Only add a [x] mark to complete the task, for tracking purposes.

**NOTE**: This stage provides a manual alternative to stage 02-a when MCP server is not available.

- [ ] 1. Analyze stage-01 artifacts and prepare comprehensive context
  - [ ] 1.1 Extract and analyze existing artifacts

## User Confirmation Gates

This stage includes critical user confirmation points:

1. **Requirements Validation Gate**: After task 1.3
   - User must explicitly confirm all access patterns are captured
   - Do not proceed to design phase without clear user approval

2. **Table-by-Table Validation Gate**: During task 3.2
   - **CRITICAL**: User must validate EACH DynamoDB table individually
   - For each table, user must confirm understanding of:
     - Purpose and source MySQL table mapping
     - Partition key and sort key design decisions
     - GSI design and cost implications
     - Denormalization decisions and trade-offs
   - Do not proceed to next table until current table is approved
   - Do not proceed to overall design approval until all tables are individually validated

3. **Overall Design Validation Gate**: After task 3.3
   - User must approve the complete data model design after table-by-table review
   - Confirm overall design approach and trade-offs are acceptable

4. **Contract Validation Gate**: After task 4.2
   - User must validate migration contract format and completeness
   - Confirm all mappings are correct and complete

**NOTE**: This stage provides a manual alternative to stage 02-a when MCP server is not available, but maintains the same quality standards and user validation gates.

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Requirements Gathering Issues:**
- If user is unsure about RPS estimates, help estimate based on business context
- If access patterns seem incomplete, ask specific questions about missing CRUD operations
- If requirements keep changing, document evolution and get explicit confirmation of final state

**Design Complexity Issues:**
- If design becomes too complex, suggest breaking down into smaller components
- If denormalization decisions are unclear, apply the decision framework systematically
- If hot partition risks are high, document mitigation strategies clearly

**Migration Contract Issues:**
- If JSON structure is incorrect, refer back to exact format in design document
- If mappings are incomplete, cross-reference with stage-01 modular artifacts and requirements
- If unique constraints are complex, implement lookup table patterns as specified
