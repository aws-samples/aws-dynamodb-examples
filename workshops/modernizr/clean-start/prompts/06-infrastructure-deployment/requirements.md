# Infrastructure Deployment - Requirements

## Introduction

The Infrastructure Deployment stage creates and deploys DynamoDB tables and monitoring infrastructure using CloudFormation templates generated from the migration contract. This stage emphasizes safety, proper configuration, and comprehensive monitoring setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to generate CloudFormation templates from the migration contract, so that I can deploy DynamoDB infrastructure consistently and repeatably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating templates THEN the system SHALL use the migrationContract.json as the definitive source for table definitions
2. WHEN creating tables THEN the system SHALL include both partition keys and sort keys as defined in the migration contract
3. WHEN configuring GSIs THEN the system SHALL include all Global Secondary Indexes with proper key schemas and projections
4. WHEN setting policies THEN the system SHALL set DeletionPolicy to Retain for all DynamoDB tables to prevent accidental data loss
5. WHEN organizing outputs THEN the system SHALL store all generated templates and outputs in the designated folder structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want to deploy DynamoDB tables with proper configuration and monitoring, so that the infrastructure is production-ready and observable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying tables THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for the AWS region and confirm deployment intentions
2. WHEN configuring tables THEN the system SHALL use appropriate billing modes and capacity settings based on the data model
3. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN the system SHALL configure CloudWatch alarms and metrics for table health
4. WHEN enabling features THEN the system SHALL configure backup policies, encryption, and other production features
5. WHEN completing deployment THEN the system SHALL validate that all tables and GSIs are properly created and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive documentation and validation of the deployed infrastructure, so that I can manage and troubleshoot the DynamoDB environment effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed documentation of all created resources
2. WHEN validating deployment THEN the system SHALL confirm that table schemas match the migration contract specifications
3. WHEN documenting configuration THEN the system SHALL record all configuration settings and deployment parameters
4. WHEN providing access THEN the system SHALL document connection information and access patterns for applications
5. WHEN enabling maintenance THEN the system SHALL provide guidance for ongoing monitoring, backup, and maintenance procedures
