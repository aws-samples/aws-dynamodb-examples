# DynamoDB Data Modeling with MCP Server - Requirements

## Introduction

The DynamoDB Data Modeling with MCP Server stage leverages specialized MCP tools to transform MySQL schema analysis into an optimized DynamoDB data model. This stage simplifies the modeling process by using expert MCP servers while maintaining comprehensive validation and producing the critical migration contract for subsequent stages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DynamoDB architect, I want to systematically gather access pattern requirements and leverage MCP server expertise, so that I can efficiently create an optimal data model based on real usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gathering requirements THEN the system SHALL analyze stage-01 artifacts to extract entities, relationships, and initial access patterns
2. WHEN documenting patterns THEN the system SHALL require RPS estimates for EVERY pattern and never fabricate numbers
3. WHEN preparing for MCP analysis THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive input documentation with all necessary context
4. WHEN requirements are incomplete THEN the system SHALL not proceed until user confirms all patterns are captured
5. WHEN requirements are complete THEN the system SHALL have documented all read and write patterns ready for MCP server analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database designer, I want to leverage MCP server expertise for DynamoDB design, so that I can apply proven design principles and patterns efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide complete context including entities, relationships, access patterns, and RPS estimates
2. WHEN requesting design THEN the system SHALL specify multi-table first approach with natural keys and access pattern driven design
3. WHEN evaluating alternatives THEN the system SHALL request multiple design options with trade-off analysis
4. WHEN receiving recommendations THEN the system SHALL validate that all access patterns are satisfied
5. WHEN finalizing design THEN the system SHALL ensure comprehensive justifications and cost analysis are provided

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious architect, I want MCP server analysis of denormalization decisions and cost implications, so that I can make informed decisions about performance vs complexity vs cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating denormalization THEN the system SHALL request MCP server analysis of denormalization trade-offs with production risk assessment
2. WHEN analyzing costs THEN the system SHALL obtain total cost of ownership analysis including development velocity and operational overhead
3. WHEN assessing risks THEN the system SHALL request hot partition vulnerability analysis and write amplification calculations
4. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL ensure explicit trade-offs with rollback strategies are documented
5. WHEN comparing approaches THEN the system SHALL obtain multiple design alternatives with clear justifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a migration engineer, I want a detailed migration contract in exact JSON format generated with MCP server assistance using comprehensive join patterns and generation standards, so that subsequent stages can automatically generate infrastructure and migration code that handles all relational data scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating migration contract THEN the system SHALL use MCP server to generate the EXACT JSON structure specified with all required fields following the comprehensive patterns defined in contracts/migration_contract_patterns.md
2. WHEN mapping attributes THEN the system SHALL ensure proper type mappings (S, N, B) and source table/column references with support for all join types including self-join, foreign-key, multi-column, conditional, chain (with optional chain_separator for concatenated results), lookup-table, and json-construction patterns
3. WHEN handling denormalization THEN the system SHALL include denormalized=true, justification, and join object specifications with proper join type classification and transformation logic
4. WHEN managing unique constraints THEN the system SHALL implement dedicated lookup tables with TransactWriteItems patterns as specified in the migration contract patterns
5. WHEN processing complex relationships THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate join patterns from the comprehensive pattern library including hierarchical data, many-to-many relationships, calculated fields, and time-based partitioning
6. WHEN generating contract schema documentation THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive field-by-field documentation with examples from all supported join patterns and transformation scenarios
7. WHEN completing contract THEN the system SHALL validate that all access patterns are satisfied by the designed tables and GSIs and that all relational data transformations are properly specified using the standardized patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation of MCP server outputs with table-by-table review, so that I can ensure the data model meets all requirements and the user understands each design decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving MCP outputs THEN the system SHALL validate that all original access patterns are addressed
2. WHEN reviewing design THEN the system SHALL conduct table-by-table validation with the user for each DynamoDB table
3. WHEN validating each table THEN the system SHALL explain the purpose, source mapping, key design, and access patterns served
4. WHEN checking user understanding THEN the system SHALL not proceed to the next table until the user confirms understanding of the current table
5. WHEN finalizing design THEN the system SHALL obtain user approval of the complete design after individual table validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a database architect, I want detailed explanation of table consolidation and denormalization decisions using standardized join patterns, so that I can understand why multiple MySQL tables are combined into single DynamoDB tables and how complex relational data is transformed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating tables THEN the system SHALL clearly explain which MySQL tables are being combined and why, referencing specific join patterns from the comprehensive pattern library
2. WHEN denormalizing data THEN the system SHALL provide detailed justification for each denormalization decision including the specific join pattern used (self-join, foreign-key, chain with optional separator, etc.) and transformation logic
3. WHEN presenting table design THEN the system SHALL show the mapping between source MySQL tables and target DynamoDB table with explicit join pattern classification and transformation specifications
4. WHEN handling complex relationships THEN the system SHALL explain how hierarchical data, many-to-many relationships, calculated fields, and other complex patterns are transformed using the standardized approach
5. WHEN validating design THEN the system SHALL ensure user understands the trade-offs of table consolidation and the implications of chosen join patterns on performance, consistency, and maintainability
6. WHEN documenting decisions THEN the system SHALL record user feedback and any concerns about table design with reference to the specific patterns and transformations used

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a migration engineer, I want comprehensive migration contract patterns and generation standards integrated into the design process, so that I can ensure consistent and reliable transformation of all relational data scenarios from MySQL to DynamoDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing source schema THEN the system SHALL identify all relationship types and map them to appropriate join patterns from the comprehensive pattern library (self-join, foreign-key, multi-column, conditional, chain, lookup-table, json-construction)
2. WHEN generating migration contracts THEN the system SHALL follow the standardized generation process including schema analysis, access pattern mapping, join pattern selection, table structure design, and contract JSON generation
3. WHEN handling complex transformations THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate patterns for calculated fields, time-based partitioning, multi-entity tables, and JSON construction with proper performance considerations
4. WHEN validating contracts THEN the system SHALL ensure schema compliance, data integrity, performance optimization, and access pattern coverage using the comprehensive validation checklist
5. WHEN documenting patterns THEN the system SHALL create migration contract schema documentation that includes field-by-field specifications, join pattern examples, validation rules, and integration guidelines for subsequent stages
