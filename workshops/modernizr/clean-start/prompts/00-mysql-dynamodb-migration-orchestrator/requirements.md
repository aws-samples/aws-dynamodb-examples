# MySQL to DynamoDB Migration Orchestrator - Requirements

## Introduction

The MySQL to DynamoDB Migration Orchestrator manages the complete end-to-end migration workflow by coordinating execution of individual migration stages. Each stage is implemented as a separate, focused spec that can be executed independently while maintaining proper dependencies and data flow between stages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a migration project manager, I want to execute a structured migration workflow with clear stage dependencies, so that I can ensure each phase completes successfully before proceeding to the next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the migration process THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide a clear sequence of stages to execute
2. WHEN a stage completes THEN the orchestrator SHALL validate required outputs exist before allowing progression
3. WHEN stage dependencies are not met THEN the orchestrator SHALL prevent execution and provide clear guidance
4. WHEN all stages complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide a comprehensive migration summary
5. WHEN issues occur THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide rollback guidance and recovery procedures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using Q, I want each migration stage to be focused and manageable, so that I can execute complex tasks without context overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a stage THEN Q SHALL have access to only the relevant requirements, design, and tasks for that stage
2. WHEN stage outputs are needed THEN Q SHALL have clear references to specific files and formats required
3. WHEN moving between stages THEN Q SHALL have explicit handoff instructions and validation criteria
4. WHEN a stage fails THEN Q SHALL have clear troubleshooting guidance specific to that stage
5. WHEN stages are complete THEN Q SHALL have validation steps to confirm successful completion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to maintain data integrity and system consistency throughout the migration, so that no data is lost or corrupted during the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows between stages THEN the orchestrator SHALL validate data format and completeness
2. WHEN critical artifacts are created THEN the orchestrator SHALL ensure they follow required specifications
3. WHEN migration phases execute THEN the orchestrator SHALL maintain audit trails and validation checkpoints
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide clear procedures for each stage
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide comprehensive validation reports
