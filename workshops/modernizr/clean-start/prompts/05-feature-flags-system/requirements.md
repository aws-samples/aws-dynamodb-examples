# Feature Flags API System - Requirements

## Introduction

The Feature Flags API System provides backend API endpoints to control the dual-database feature flags implemented in stages 03-04. This system enables controlled migration from MySQL to DynamoDB through simple API calls, keeping the frontend completely transparent to the migration process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a migration engineer, I want to implement backend API endpoints to control the dual-database feature flags, so that I can manage migration phases through simple API calls without affecting the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints to get and set feature flag configurations
2. WHEN implementing flag control THEN the system SHALL use the existing dual-database abstraction from stages 03-04
3. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL use real databases (DynamoDB Local and MySQL) without mock tests or mock data
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute tests before and after each substantive change
5. WHEN managing flags THEN the system SHALL support updating individual flags or complete migration phase configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to control the dual-database system through API endpoints, so that I can safely manage migration phases without modifying code or restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing flag control THEN the system SHALL expose the existing dual-database functionality through API endpoints
2. WHEN updating flags THEN the system SHALL update the global feature flags that control read/write operations
3. WHEN changing migration phases THEN the system SHALL provide predefined phase configurations for easy migration management
4. WHEN logging operations THEN the system SHALL log all flag changes and their effects on database operations
5. WHEN testing flag control THEN the system SHALL test all API endpoints with real database operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data validation engineer, I want to control dual-read validation through API endpoints, so that I can enable/disable data consistency checking during migration phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN controlling validation THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints to enable/disable dual-read validation
2. WHEN providing validation status THEN the system SHALL expose validation results and discrepancy reports through API endpoints
3. WHEN managing validation settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of validation strictness and error handling
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints to retrieve validation error logs and reports
5. WHEN testing validation control THEN the system SHALL test all validation API endpoints with various data scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the frontend to remain completely transparent to the migration process, so that I don't need to modify any frontend code during the database migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL handle requests transparently regardless of which database is being used
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL route them according to feature flags without frontend knowledge
3. WHEN migration phases change THEN the system SHALL not require any frontend code changes or restarts
4. WHEN providing API responses THEN the system SHALL return consistent response formats regardless of the underlying database
5. WHEN maintaining compatibility THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing API contracts and response structures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a migration project manager, I want API endpoints that support predefined migration phases, so that I can execute a controlled, reversible migration process through simple API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing phase control THEN the system SHALL offer API endpoints for: MySQL-only, dual-write+MySQL-read, dual-write+dual-read, dual-write+DynamoDB-read, DynamoDB-only
2. WHEN transitioning phases THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints to safely transition between migration phases
3. WHEN documenting API THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive API documentation with examples for each endpoint
4. WHEN validating phases THEN the system SHALL test all API endpoints and validate phase transition capabilities
5. WHEN completing implementation THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for monitoring and status reporting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want a hidden frontend page to control the migration API endpoints, so that I can manage database migration phases through a secure web interface accessible only to super admins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin page THEN the system SHALL restrict access to users with super admin privileges only
2. WHEN providing migration controls THEN the system SHALL create a frontend page that interfaces with all migration API endpoints
3. WHEN displaying migration status THEN the system SHALL show current phase, feature flags, and validation status in real-time
4. WHEN managing phases THEN the system SHALL provide controls to transition between all 5 migration phases safely
5. WHEN monitoring validation THEN the system SHALL display validation statistics, error logs, and data discrepancy reports
6. WHEN securing the interface THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization for super admin access
7. WHEN managing super admin users THEN the system SHALL provide database migration to add super_admin field and method to promote users to super admin
8. WHEN integrating with existing frontend THEN the system SHALL follow existing frontend patterns and styling without breaking functionality
