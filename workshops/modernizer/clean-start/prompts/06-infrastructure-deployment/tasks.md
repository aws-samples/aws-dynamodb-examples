# Infrastructure Deployment - Tasks

## COMMIT FREQUENCY AND TASK COMPLETION

**IMPORTANT**: 
- **Commit changes frequently** throughout this stage to maintain a clean Git history
- **Use `git -P`** to avoid interactive prompts
- **Mark tasks as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` as you finish each task
- **Commit after each major task completion** with descriptive messages
- **Update the tasks.md file** itself when marking tasks complete and commit those changes too
- **Use single working log**: Use `artifacts/stage-06/06_working_log.md` throughout the entire stage (not individual logs per subtask)
- **DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE**: Only add a [x] mark to complete the task, for tracking purposes.
