# Dual-Database Abstraction - Requirements

## Introduction

The Dual-Database Abstraction stage creates a dual-database capability in the backend application that allows simultaneous connections to both MySQL and DynamoDB with global feature flags controlling read/write operations. This stage focuses exclusively on the backend/ folder and does not require any frontend modifications.

**Dual-Database Architecture**: The system will support simultaneous connections to both databases with global feature flags (READ_MYSQL, READ_DDB, WRITE_MYSQL, WRITE_DDB) that control all read and write operations across the entire backend without requiring individual API-level configuration.

**Discovery-Driven Approach**: This stage uses a discovery-first methodology where the system first explores the actual backend codebase, then generates detailed, code-specific requirements and design specifications for implementing the dual-database capability based on what it finds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want to analyze the existing backend codebase and create a dual-database abstraction layer, so that I can simultaneously connect to both MySQL and DynamoDB with global feature flags controlling read/write operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the backend codebase THEN the system SHALL determine the programming language, database technologies, test framework, and dependency injection patterns used in the backend/ folder
2. WHEN locating DAL files THEN the system SHALL identify all data access related files in the backend/ folder and document current MySQL data access patterns
3. WHEN mapping dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies between backend components and existing test coverage in the backend test suite
4. WHEN creating dual-database interfaces THEN the system SHALL create abstract interfaces that support both MySQL and DynamoDB operations simultaneously
5. WHEN defining interfaces THEN the system SHALL follow existing backend naming conventions and support global feature flag control for read/write operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement dual-database concrete classes with global feature flag support, so that I can maintain existing MySQL behavior while simultaneously supporting DynamoDB operations controlled by global flags.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating dual-database implementations THEN the system SHALL create backend implementation classes that support both MySQL and DynamoDB simultaneously
2. WHEN preserving behavior THEN the system SHALL maintain existing MySQL backend behavior exactly while adding DynamoDB capability
3. WHEN implementing feature flag system THEN the system SHALL support global flags (READ_MYSQL, READ_DDB, WRITE_MYSQL, WRITE_DDB) that control all operations
4. WHEN handling configuration THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid configurations and support runtime flag switching
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing backend tests pass with MySQL while adding DynamoDB test capability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to update the test suite to work with the dual-database abstraction layer, so that I can maintain test coverage and verify consistent behavior across both MySQL and DynamoDB with different feature flag configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating backend tests THEN the system SHALL maintain existing backend test coverage and verify consistent behavior across both MySQL and DynamoDB
2. WHEN refactoring backend tests THEN the system SHALL support testing with different feature flag configurations (READ/write combinations)
3. WHEN testing configurations THEN the system SHALL test all feature flag combinations and error scenarios
4. WHEN running backend test suite THEN the system SHALL ensure all backend tests pass with both database configurations
5. WHEN supporting dual-database operations THEN the system SHALL run the same backend test code against both MySQL and DynamoDB with feature flag control
