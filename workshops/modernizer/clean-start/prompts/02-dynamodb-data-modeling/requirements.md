# DynamoDB Data Modeling - Requirements

## Introduction

The DynamoDB Data Modeling stage transforms MySQL schema analysis into an optimized DynamoDB data model using proven design principles and comprehensive trade-off analysis. This stage implements a systematic approach with user validation gates and produces the critical migration contract for subsequent stages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DynamoDB architect, I want to systematically gather and document all access pattern requirements with accurate RPS estimates, so that I can design an optimal data model based on real usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gathering requirements THEN the system SHALL maintain `dynamodb_requirement.md` as a working scratchpad updated after EVERY user message
2. WHEN documenting access patterns THEN the system SHALL require RPS estimates for EVERY pattern and never fabricate numbers
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive access patterns analysis table with RPS, type, attributes, and design considerations
4. WHEN requirements are incomplete THEN the system SHALL not proceed until user confirms all patterns are captured
5. WHEN requirements are complete THEN the system SHALL have documented all read and write patterns with proper validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database designer, I want to apply proven DynamoDB design principles and patterns, so that I can create a scalable and cost-effective data model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting design THEN the system SHALL use multi-table first approach (separate tables per entity, not single-table optimization)
2. WHEN naming keys THEN the system SHALL use natural, descriptive keys (user_id, order_id) not generic ones (PK, SK)
3. WHEN designing tables THEN the system SHALL design each table from query patterns, not entity structure
4. WHEN considering denormalization THEN the system SHALL apply evidence-based decision framework with hot partition analysis
5. WHEN evaluating relationships THEN the system SHALL consider identifying relationships to eliminate GSIs and reduce costs by 50%

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious architect, I want to evaluate denormalization decisions with comprehensive trade-off analysis, so that I can make informed decisions about performance vs complexity vs cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating denormalization THEN the system SHALL apply the denormalization decision framework with production risk assessment
2. WHEN analyzing costs THEN the system SHALL evaluate total cost of ownership including development velocity and operational overhead
3. WHEN assessing risks THEN the system SHALL perform hot partition vulnerability analysis and write amplification calculations
4. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL document explicit trade-offs with rollback strategies
5. WHEN recommending approaches THEN the system SHALL provide multiple design alternatives with clear justifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a migration engineer, I want a detailed migration contract in exact JSON format, so that subsequent stages can automatically generate infrastructure and migration code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating migration contract THEN the system SHALL follow the EXACT JSON structure specified with all required fields
2. WHEN mapping attributes THEN the system SHALL include proper type mappings (S, N, B) and source table/column references
3. WHEN handling denormalization THEN the system SHALL include denormalized=true, justification, and join object specifications
4. WHEN managing unique constraints THEN the system SHALL implement dedicated lookup tables with TransactWriteItems patterns
5. WHEN completing contract THEN the system SHALL validate that all access patterns are satisfied by the designed tables and GSIs
