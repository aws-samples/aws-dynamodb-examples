# Data Migration Execution - Requirements

## Introduction

The Data Migration Execution stage performs the actual data migration from MySQL to DynamoDB using AWS Glue ETL jobs and MySQL views. This stage emphasizes data integrity, comprehensive validation, and safe migration practices with proper monitoring and rollback capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to create MySQL views that transform data according to the migration contract, so that I can extract data in the format required for DynamoDB loading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating views THEN the system SHALL run generate_mysql_views.py script for each DynamoDB table defined in the migration contract
2. WHEN generating SQL THEN the system SHALL create a single .sql file containing all resulting SQL statements
3. WHEN executing SQL THEN the system SHALL run the generated SQL against the user's MySQL database using MCP server connectivity
4. WHEN handling transformations THEN the system SHALL apply all data transformations specified in the migration contract
5. WHEN managing denormalized data THEN the system SHALL properly handle joins and data denormalization as specified in the contract

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a migration engineer, I want to create and execute AWS Glue ETL jobs that safely migrate data with validation, so that I can ensure data integrity throughout the migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Glue jobs THEN the system SHALL run create_glue_and_run.py with parameters from the migration contract
2. WHEN configuring jobs THEN the system SHALL use view names from the previous step and proper AWS credentials
3. WHEN executing migration THEN the system SHALL perform incremental data migration with conditional writes to prevent data corruption
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL provide data validation and integrity checks throughout the process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and validation of the migration process, so that I can ensure successful completion and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring migration THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress tracking and status updates
2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and provide troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN ensuring consistency THEN the system SHALL verify AWS region consistency between infrastructure and Glue jobs
4. WHEN using connectivity THEN the system SHALL use MCP servers for database connectivity where available
5. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive migration completion and validation reports
