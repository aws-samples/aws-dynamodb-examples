# üöÄ DynamoDB Modernization Infrastructure

> **CloudFormation Template for MySQL to DynamoDB Migration Workshop**

A comprehensive CloudFormation template that sets up all required infrastructure components for the database modernization workshop, simulating an on-premises environment with MySQL database and providing the complete toolkit for migration to Amazon DynamoDB.

## üîß Infrastructure Components

This template (`modernizer-db.yaml`) creates the following resources:

### üíª Development Environment
- **VS Code Server**: Browser-based development environment with pre-installed tools
- **User Authentication**: Secure password-protected access to development environment
- **Workshop Files**: Pre-loaded repository with workshop materials and utilities

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Infrastructure
- **MySQL Database**: Fully configured MySQL instance with sample e-commerce data
- **Database Credentials**: Auto-generated secure credentials for database access
- **Database Monitoring**: Performance logging and monitoring tools

### üîå Network Configuration
- **Security Groups**: Properly configured access rules for secure communication
- **VPC Endpoints**: Optimized connectivity for AWS services
- **CloudFront Distribution**: Fast, secure access to the development environment

### üë§ IAM Resources
- **DynamoDB Replication Role**: IAM role for DynamoDB streams and replication
- **Glue Service Role**: Permissions for ETL processes between MySQL and DynamoDB
- **Lambda Execution Roles**: Properly scoped permissions for utility functions

### üîÑ Migration Components
- **S3 Bucket**: Staging area for migration data
- **Glue Connections**: Pre-configured connection to MySQL database
- **Docker Support**: Container environment for compatibility testing

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying this CloudFormation template, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account Access**: Administrative permissions in your AWS account
2. **Public IP Address**: Your current public IP address for security group configuration
3. **Region Selection**: Choose a region with support for all required services
4. **CloudFormation Knowledge**: Basic understanding of AWS CloudFormation

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy CloudFormation Template

1. Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console
2. Click "Create stack" > "With new resources"
3. Upload the `modernizer-db.yaml` file
4. Complete the parameters form with required information:
   - Environment name
   - Your public IP address for access control

### Step 2: Accessing Your Development Environment.
Once your CloudFormation template is CREATE_COMPLETE, access the "Outputs" tab to retrieve your environment credentials.

Locate these two important values:
   - VSCodeServerPassword - Authentication credential for your VS Code instance
   - VSCodeServerURLModernizer - Direct endpoint to your cloud-based IDE

Your values are unique to you and will differ from the above example.

Click the VSCodeServerURLModernizer to launch your development environment. Enter the password when prompted and allow approximately 60 seconds for the environment to initialize. Any startup notifications can be safely dismissed.

## üöÆ Cleanup Instructions

1. Delete DynamoDB tables (Users, Products, Categories) created for this workshop.
2. Delete Glue jobs (users_migration_job, product_migration_job, categories_migration_job) created for this workshop.
3. Delete the stack, it should delete the rest of the resources.
