# DynamoDB Implementation - Requirements

## Introduction

The DynamoDB Implementation stage creates a complete Data Access Layer implementation for DynamoDB following the migrationContract.json specifications from stage 02-dynamodb-data-modeling. This stage emphasizes test-driven development, incremental implementation, and comprehensive error handling while maintaining compatibility with the existing abstraction layer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a proper testing environment and establish a baseline, so that I can implement DynamoDB operations with confidence and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the test environment THEN the system SHALL identify the testing framework and commands used in the repository
2. WHEN preparing DynamoDB testing THEN the system SHALL run DynamoDB Local via Docker for integration testing
3. WHEN establishing baseline THEN the system SHALL run the repository's test suite to establish baseline functionality
4. WHEN documenting procedures THEN the system SHALL document test execution procedures specific to this repository
5. WHEN validating environment THEN the system SHALL ensure test databases are available and operational

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want to implement DynamoDB operations incrementally following the data model, so that I can build a robust implementation with proper validation at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing operations THEN the system SHALL follow the migrationContract.json specifications exactly for storage and query decisions, using the data model documentation as supporting reference
2. WHEN building incrementally THEN the system SHALL implement one entity at a time, testing after each implementation
3. WHEN preserving data THEN the system SHALL keep MySQL-generated IDs in the same format, casting to match DynamoDB data type
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL run tests before ANY changes and after EVERY substantive change using real DynamoDB Local
5. WHEN handling limitations THEN the system SHALL implement proper handling for DynamoDB-specific constraints (400KB item size, throughput limits)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that the DynamoDB implementation is production-ready with proper observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive error handling for all DynamoDB operations
2. WHEN managing throughput THEN the system SHALL handle provisioned throughput exceeded exceptions with exponential backoff
3. WHEN ensuring reliability THEN the system SHALL implement idempotent operations where possible
4. WHEN monitoring operations THEN the system SHALL add detailed error logging and performance monitoring for all database operations
5. WHEN configuring for production THEN the system SHALL refine SDK configuration to use defaults and proper credential providers
