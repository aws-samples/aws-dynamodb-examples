# MySQL Analysis - Requirements

## Introduction

The MySQL Analysis stage extracts complete database schema information and analyzes access patterns from the online shopping store application to provide the foundation for DynamoDB data model design. This stage uses Git version control for tracking changes, Python scripts for MySQL log analysis, and MCP server connectivity for schema extraction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database architect, I want to set up proper version control and working environment, so that I can track changes and maintain a clean development process throughout the migration analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the project THEN the system SHALL set up Git version control at the workspace root
2. WHEN creating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude compiled artifacts, node_modules, and build files while tracking source code
3. WHEN setting up working environment THEN the system SHALL create working log files in the artifacts/ directory for tracking progress
4. WHEN completing tasks THEN the system SHALL commit changes with meaningful commit messages
5. WHEN using Git operations THEN the system SHALL use git -P flag to avoid interactive mode issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database architect, I want to extract complete MySQL schema information from the online shopping store database, so that I can understand the current data structure, relationships, and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to MySQL database via MCP server THEN the system SHALL use the execute_sql tool to run schema extraction queries
2. WHEN extracting table definitions THEN the system SHALL write and execute SQL queries to get table structures, column definitions, data types, and constraints for users, products, categories, orders, and order_items tables
3. WHEN analyzing relationships THEN the system SHALL use SQL queries to identify foreign key relationships and constraints between e-commerce entities
4. WHEN extracting indexes THEN the system SHALL query INFORMATION_SCHEMA to document all primary keys, foreign keys, and secondary indexes
5. WHEN analyzing constraints THEN the system SHALL use SQL queries to identify unique constraints, check constraints, and referential integrity rules
6. WHEN schema extraction completes THEN the system SHALL generate focused documentation artifacts for each analysis component

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database architect, I want to analyze the backend API structure and endpoints, so that I can understand application-level access patterns and how the application interacts with the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the backend THEN the system SHALL examine the backend/ folder structure and README.md to understand API endpoints
2. WHEN exploring API routes THEN the system SHALL identify all available endpoints and their corresponding database operations
3. WHEN documenting access patterns THEN the system SHALL explain the relationship between different e-commerce entities from the API perspective
4. WHEN analyzing API design THEN the system SHALL understand how users, products, categories, orders, and order_items are accessed through the application
5. WHEN API analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate focused API access pattern artifacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to analyze MySQL query patterns and performance metrics using the existing Python log parser, so that I can identify access patterns and optimization opportunities for DynamoDB design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL use the mysql_log_parser.py script from the database/ folder to process query logs
2. WHEN processing logs THEN the system SHALL extract query statistics including frequency, throughput, and query type distribution
3. WHEN identifying access patterns THEN the system SHALL document read/write frequencies, query complexity, and data access patterns for the online shopping store
4. WHEN analyzing queries THEN the system SHALL identify patterns suitable and unsuitable for DynamoDB based on the e-commerce workload
5. WHEN performance analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate focused access pattern artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database architect, I want to combine API analysis, schema analysis, and performance analysis into modular artifacts, so that I can provide complete foundation information for DynamoDB data modeling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating artifacts THEN the system SHALL create focused, modular documentation files for each analysis component
2. WHEN documenting entity relationships THEN the system SHALL create separate artifacts for schema structure and relationship analysis
3. WHEN presenting table structures THEN the system SHALL generate detailed artifacts with column definitions, data types, and constraints
4. WHEN documenting access patterns THEN the system SHALL create specific artifacts for performance analysis and access pattern identification
5. WHEN completing analysis THEN the system SHALL NOT suggest DynamoDB table structures but focus on understanding current state through modular artifacts
